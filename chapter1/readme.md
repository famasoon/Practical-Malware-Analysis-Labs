# Chapter 1 Labs
## Lab 1-1
1. EXE: Detected 34/62
   DLL: Detected 24/60
2. EXE: Compiled "2010-12-19 16:16:19".
   DLL: Compiled "2010-12-19 16:16:38".
3. EXE: "Armadillo v1.71"
   DLL: "Armadillo v1.xx - v2.xx"
4. The EXE imports file manipulation API.
   The DLL imports network API.
```

5. EXE: This contains string "kerne132.dll" (It isn't "kernel32"). It seems that is hiding malicious activity.
6. DLL: This contains string "127.26.152.13"(127.0.0.0/8 is loopback-address).
7. EXE: This exe file copies DLL to "C:\\windows\\system32\\kerne132.dll".
   DLL: This dll file talks C&C server that is IP address "127.26.152.13".

## Lab 1-2
1. Detected 39/60
2. The sections named "UPX0", "UPX1", "UPX2". So this file packed "UPX" that is unpacking easy.
3. CreateServiceA, LoadLibraryA and InternetOpenA.
4. After unpacking this file, it contains string "http://www.malwareanalysisbook.com" and "Internet Explorer 8.0". I would guess that these string are used to connect the C&C.

## Lab 1-3
1. Detected 54/61
2. The PEiD detected "FSG v1.00 (Eng) -> dulek/xt".
3. These function are used packer that will load a real code.
```
[+] KERNEL32.dll
LoadLibraryA
GetProcAddress
```
4. "FSG" is difficult to unpack, so I could not find a real strings.
