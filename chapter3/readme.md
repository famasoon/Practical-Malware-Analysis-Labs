# Chapter 3 Labs
## Lab 3-1
1. These are malware's imports. 
It is packed, so it's imports few.
```
[+] kernel32.dll
ExitProcess
```
These are strings that is contained in malware. 
You can find the URL in it.
```
0x000018E5: 'SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Shell Folders'
0x00001735: 'SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run'
0x0000004E: 'This program cannot be run in DOS mode.   $'

2. I couldn't run this malware, so I don't write this section.
3. Same as above.

## Lab 3-2
1. I used [CFF Explorer](http://www.ntcore.com/exsuite.php) to view Export table.
This DLL has the following exports
```
Install
ServiceMain
UninstallService
installA
uninstallA
```
From these, I guess that I can install by entering command
```
rundll32.exe Lab03-02.dll, installA
```
(However, this command may not be working)
2. I couldn't run service...
```
>net start IPRIP
The service name is invalid.

More help is available by typing NET HELPMSG 2185.

```
Perhaps the installation could not be done well

1. Added svchost.exe.
But it closed soon, and Lab03-03.exe show error

The application was unable to correctly (0x0000005). Click OK to

It this also not possible... :(

## Lab 3-4
1. The file deletes itself.
2. Be deleted immediately
3. I tried to use command line option(-cc), but it did not work.
